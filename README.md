# Friends List App

Hello my name is Darko Gjorgjiev and i am starting to learn Ruby on Rails. 

This is my first project made with a tutorial called: Rails Friends List App!

Like in the old times when we used to write our contacts in notebook, now you can do the same thing just on a web app, and besides the contact number
of the person, you can add their email, twitter account.

I posted it on heroku so that everyone can you it.
Feel free to try it:
